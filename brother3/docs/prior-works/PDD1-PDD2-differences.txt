Tandy licensed the TPDD-1 design from Brother. Brother's version is
the FB-100. Set for 9600baud, a Tandy TPDD-1 behaves identically to a
Brother FB-100.

The FB-100 (and the TPDD-1) actually implements two protocols: the FDC
mode (sector based) and a File-based mode. TEENY, TS-DOS use the
file-based mode. So does the WP-2. The knitting machines and various
pattern editing computers for the same knitting machines use the FDC
mode. Note that they do not use the same kind of cable that we do (the
TPDD cables have electronics built in to do line level conversions
leeching power from the flow control lines).

Now, the TPDD-2 does not implement the FDC mode. Instead it has only
the file-access protocol, with a couple of additional commands for
selecting tracks and raw read/write to disk sectors. The TPDD-2 could
therefore never be used with a Brother knitting machine unless you
replaced its ROM program.
