KH930 PPD/FDD pattern format

There are many things saved in the two physical sectors written when a pattern
is saved. What I am describing at this point is limited to a single row of
pattern data.

For this test I created a 200 stitch, one row pattern. A 200 stitch, one-row
pattern is 25 bytes of "on-off" data. It can be represented as a hexadecimal
string as follows:

01 22 01 12 03 45 53 44
53 67 88 67 78 69 AB B9
AA B9 CD EE CD DE CF 01
1F

On the km display it looks like off-off-off-off-off-off-off-on- (01), etc., all
the way out to off-off-off-on-on-on-on-on at the end (1F).

I entered this pattern in at the keypad and saved the pattern to the first
track of a floppy. Then I read this track information off of the disk and saved
it into a file.

By comparing this file to one with another pattern in it, I was able to detect
the location of the pattern. For a one-row pattern, the pattern is repeated
twice, once starting at an offset of 0x06e6 and the second starting at an
offset of 0x0716.

The data is as follows:

f8 00 f3 80 b3 7b b3 77
55 9d d5 9d 1e 96 11 e6
ca e6 ca 22 c0 a2 80 48
80 44

As you can see there is one "extra" byte of data here, which is due to
word-alignment.

It turns out that by reversing the bit order of the saved pattern we get a lot
closer to the pattern I gave orignally:

22 01 12 01 45 03 44 53
67 53 67 88 69 78 b9 ab
b9 aa ee cd de cd 01 cf
00 1f

To get the orginal pattern, just consider the pattern as an array of 16-bit
words, and swap the high and low bytes to get:

01 22   01 12   03 45   53 44
53 67   88 67   78 69   ab b9
aa b9   cd ee   cd de   cf 01
1f 00

Which is the same as the entered pattern, assuming we ignore the 00 tacked on
to the end to pad the last word.

So, we can think of each pattern row as an array of 13 16-bit words, with the
rightmost stitches appearing at the start of the pattern, and the leftmost
stitches at the end.  Within each 16-bit word, the rightmost stitches appear in
the low byte, and the leftmost stitches appear in the high byte. Within each
byte, the leftmost stitches appear in the low nibble, and the rightmost
stitches appear in the high nibble. Within each nibble, the stitches appear
with the least significant bit representing the leftmost stitch, and the most
significant bit representing the rightmost stitch.
