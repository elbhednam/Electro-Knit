Pinout for straight through PC to Brother FDD cable.

Can also be used to connect a PC to a Brother 930 knitting machine,
but either a null modem adapter needs to be added in or the
TX and RX lines must be crossed when building this cable.

As far as wiring, this should be equivalent to a DAK cable + null
modem adapter. However, there is a possibility there are some
electronics in the DAK cable, just like there is in the TRS-80
TPDD-1 cable.

8-pin terminal connector

Pins are numbered as if you were looking at exposed portion of
a connector at the ends of a Brother FB-100 floppy drive
cable. The DB-25 end is intended to hook to a PC (DTE). The 8-pin
end connects to a FB-100 wired as DCE. Keep in mind that a the km
is wired as DTE. If you want to connect a PC directly to a KM,
you'll need to cross for null modem (DTE<->DTE) or use an 
off-the-shelf null modem.

Connections:

8-pin    25-pin

5        2
7        6
8        7
N-C      1,8-19,21-25

If building your own, you may want to look up the RS232 specs on
the web and make the serial port end a DB-9. Most PCs and
USB<->RS232 adapters use DB-9 connectors, not DB-25.

I have a working cable, so I have not tried to build one myself.
I'm interested in whether anyone has success with it.

Please send questions/corrections/feedback and success/failure
stories to jhoger@pobox.com
